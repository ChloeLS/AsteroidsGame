## Asteroids Game

My second game in java, created in Spring 2018.

## Getting Started

Arrows keys are used to move the ship. 
The asteroids, bullets and the ship wrap around the level edges. 
The ship and asteroids will drift as if in space and move independantly this way.
The space bar is used to shoot the bullets. Bullets are counted and asteroids destroyed by bullet will cause an increase in score.
Asteroid can be destroyed by shooting them with a bullet; which will increase score.
Asteroids can also be destroyed by the ship crashing into them, however this will cause a reduction in lives by 1 and reduction in score by 10. 
Each time all the coloured asteroids in the level are destroyed, more asteroids will respawn and the level of the game will increase by 1.
Each level has different coloured asteroids.
Some levels may spawn a pink enemy ship.
If the player manages to detroy all asteroids in the game they will win the game.
If the players loses all their lives they will lose the game.
At the end of the game, the players is shown their score and all of the scores on the leaderboard.
